Create a dockerfile to build a jenkins container and a script that runs it.
Create a docker-compose file to start your jenkins container.
The jenkins container is up on port 80, a seedjob should load your previously created groovy file to create the build job for your docker image.
Add a job to run your 'ip/hostname' image, let me run the image against your localhost.
